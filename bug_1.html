        <p>
            As per ministry of truth request me and 3 other Helldivers embarked on a reconissance mission
            to Hellmire. Our mission was to ascertain activity of a new strain of Terminids in the area. Below is what we found...

            As expected, a new strain was located and investigated. The Terminids displayed a capability to fly for an undetermined amount of time
            They did not display any ability to attack from a distance such as Bile Spewers. We have also located a new type of nest, specifically designed to house and deploy
            the flying terminids. After a brief evaluation of their movement patterns and strike tactics we have retreated to the LZ.
        </p>

            Unfortunately, during evac, two acompanying Helldivers were lost to the new strain of terminids.
